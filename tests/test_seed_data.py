"""Data integrity tests for seed_bank.py.

Pure Python tests (no DB needed) that validate the seed data against the spec:
- 11 sub-situations total
- 3 encounter words per encounter
- First 5 encounters per sub-situation are free
- No duplicate Spanish words within the same sub-situation
- Sequential encounter numbering within each sub-situation
- All word_ids in SITUATION_WORDS exist in ENCOUNTER_WORDS
