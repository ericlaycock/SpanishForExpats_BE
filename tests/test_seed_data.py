"""Data integrity tests for seed_bank.py.

Pure Python tests (no DB needed) that validate the seed data against the spec:
- 10 sub-situations total (banking and restaurant collapsed to 1 each)
- 50 encounters per sub-situation = 500 total
- 3 encounter words per encounter = 1,500 total
- First 5 encounters per sub-situation are free
- No duplicate Spanish words within the same sub-situation
- Sequential encounter_number (1-50) within each sub-situation
- All word_ids in SITUATION_WORDS exist in ENCOUNTER_WORDS
